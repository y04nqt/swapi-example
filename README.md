# How to Start
- you'll need npm and node as a prerequisite inorder to start up this project. 
- open up your terminal and run `npm install`
- once that is done, run `npm run start`

## some thoughts
- I didn't include any tests because it would take me extra time than the requested amount
- I used a mix of Tailwind and MUI for haste, not something that is recommended but I like the utility of TW.
- I could have used more material components, but I wanted to show off some TW tricks, plus TW tends to be a bit faster for me
- I try to keep to the react way of architecting paradigm and do what is necessary for the time being. I could have taken the code and broken it out into more files. For this project, I decided to keep helpers and other exportables/importables in the file I created it in to start.
- I chose CRA because it was easy to spin up and get started, for this project it worked perfectly due to the nature of simple data retrieval. If the use-cases for this were more expansive, I may pick a different tech stack that would have more technology available for advance use cases.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
